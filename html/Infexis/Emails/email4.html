      Hello again, Raphael.<br>
      I loathe to ask another favor of you so soon, but there have been some unfortunate events lately.<br>
      My... 'Seer' managed to slip away for a short time a couple of days ago, and I hate to admit that the bastard<br>
      managed to embrace some poor sod.<br><br>
      I wanted to simply take care of this quietly and quickly, but for reasons I do not feel comftorable sharing like this,<br>
      I do not feel that the standard procedure is apt for this situation.<br>
      <br>
      So again I ask a favor of you and yours. Take in this newblood and try your best to teach him our ways. To be clear,<br>
      this individual does not have any kind of special status, if he cannot behave then you know what must be done.<br>
      <br>
      I owe you and yours a lot already, and as a small act of good faith, I want to offer you the services of our local havens.<br>
      Our good friend Simon Mahara runs a prominent real estate company in town, and those in our upper echelons enjoy free access<br>
      to any and all of these havens. Simply look for any estate which is owned by Mahara Real Estates, and if any apartment or house<br>
      is owned or rented by one 'Anna Jay Smith', it is kept safe and stocked at all times, and you may freely use it for your own convenience.
